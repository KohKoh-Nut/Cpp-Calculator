## Introduction
This project aims to create a console executable file which works like a scientific calculator (takes in mathematical expression and output the result).
It is my first real proect which I make on my own and it's going to record my journey of learning programming, especially C++, so it doesn't use the best method to evaluate, but at least works.
It's currently only workable in console, but there're potential uses like combining with a GUI to make a scientific calculator app.

## Features
* Do basic arithmatic operations
* Deal with orders
* Process brackets
### To-Do
* Constants (eg. pi)
* Mathematical functions (eg. trigonometric functions)
* Other Modes

## User Guide
1. Type in the expression.
2. Get the result.<br />
